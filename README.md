Unoffical Gopeed Extension

Use Existing [Gopeed Server](https://github.com/GopeedLab/gopeed) and upload downloads directly to it. This is meant as a temporary solution untill there is an offical solution

After adding Server, just left click and select "Download-Through" and then select the server you want to download to.
